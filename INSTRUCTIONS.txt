Included in this zip archive are a series of data files (csv) with information about fictitious medical claims. The files are organized somewhat like a relational database.

We would like you to write code that takes these files as input, and returns one or more consolidated csv reports that can be used to easily answer the following questions:

1) What is the average per-claim cost across all members?

2) What is the most expensive company in terms of claims cost?

3) Who are the most expensive patients?

You may use whatever programming language you'd prefer. Please submit both the code you write and the final CSV output.
